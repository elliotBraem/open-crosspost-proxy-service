# Twitter API Proxy Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project has progressed from the initial setup phase to implementation. The core infrastructure, authentication system, API endpoints, and middleware have been implemented. The focus is now on testing, refinement, and ensuring all components work together seamlessly.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the core project structure with TypeScript
- Set up the routing system using itty-router
- Created authentication middleware and OAuth flow
- Implemented CORS and error handling middleware
- Developed tweet, like, and media handling services
- Implemented comprehensive error handling
- Removed timeline service to focus on core action functionality

## Active Decisions

1. **Authentication Implementation**:
   - OAuth 2.0 with PKCE has been implemented for secure authentication
   - Token storage and refresh mechanisms are in place
   - API key validation for client applications is working

2. **API Structure**:
   - RESTful API design with consistent endpoint patterns
   - Structured error responses with detailed information
   - Service-based architecture for clean separation of concerns

3. **Media Handling Strategy**:
   - Using OAuth 1.0a for media uploads (Twitter API requirement)
   - Supporting both direct uploads and pre-uploaded media IDs
   - Implementing chunked uploads for large media files
   - Supporting alt text for accessibility

## Next Steps

1. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Comprehensive testing of all endpoints
   - Edge case handling and error recovery
   - Performance testing under load
   - Security testing and validation

2. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation for client developers
   - Internal documentation for maintenance
   - Example code and usage patterns

3. **Deployment and Monitoring**:
   - Set up staging and production environments
   - Configure monitoring and alerting
   - Implement logging and analytics

4. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Additional Twitter API functionality
   - Enhanced rate limiting strategies
   - Improved error handling and recovery

## Current Challenges

1. **Media Upload Complexity**:
   - Handling large media uploads within Workers execution constraints
   - Managing the Twitter API's complex media upload process
   - Supporting various media types and formats

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implementing effective rate limit tracking
   - Balancing client needs with Twitter API limitations
   - Developing appropriate backoff strategies

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error classification and handling
   - Providing meaningful error messages to clients
   - Implementing proper recovery mechanisms

## Open Questions

1. How can we optimize the media upload process for better performance?
2. What's the best strategy for handling rate limits across multiple users?
3. How should we implement circuit breaking for Twitter API failures?
4. What metrics should we prioritize for monitoring and alerting?

## Current Development Environment

- Using Bun for package management and running scripts
- Local development using Wrangler for Workers simulation
- Testing against Twitter API
- TypeScript with strict type checking
- Jest for unit and integration testing
