# Social Media API Proxy Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are currently refactoring the project's types and schemas to follow a more centralized approach. The goal is to have a single source of truth for both TypeScript types and Zod schemas, with TypeScript types being derived from Zod schemas. This will ensure consistency between validation and type checking throughout the codebase.

The refactoring involves:
1. Moving all Zod schemas from `src/schemas` to the `packages/types/src` directory
2. Organizing schemas by domain rather than by request/response
3. Deriving TypeScript types from schemas using `z.infer<typeof schemaName>`
4. Updating imports throughout the codebase to reference the new location of schemas and types

This refactoring will improve maintainability, ensure type safety, and provide a clearer separation of concerns.

## Recent Changes

- **Refactoring types and schemas**: Currently refactoring the project to centralize schema and type definitions in the `packages/types` package, with TypeScript types derived from Zod schemas.
- **Organized types and schemas**: Reorganized the types and schemas in the project to ensure consistency and maintainability. Moved enhanced response types from `src/types/enhanced-response.types.ts` to `packages/types/src/common/enhanced-response.ts`. Created utility functions for working with schemas in `src/schemas/utils.ts`. Added documentation explaining the relationship between types and schemas.
- **Implemented comprehensive response schemas**: Created response schemas for all API endpoints with OpenAPI metadata, mirroring the existing request schemas. These schemas are organized in the `src/schemas/responses` directory and include post, auth, media, and rate limit responses.
- **Created SDK architecture**: Designed and implemented a modular SDK architecture consisting of three separate packages: `@crosspost/types` for shared type definitions, `@crosspost/near-simple-signing` for NEAR signature generation, and `@crosspost/sdk` for the main API client.
- **Completed migration from Cloudflare Workers to Deno Deploy**
- Switched from itty-router to Hono for HTTP routing
- Replaced Cloudflare KV with Deno KV for token storage
- Updated dependencies to use Deno-compatible imports
- Implemented NEAR wallet signature-based authentication
- Created platform abstraction interfaces (PlatformClient, PlatformAuth, PlatformPost,
  PlatformMedia, PlatformProfile)
- Developed Twitter-specific implementations of these interfaces
- Implemented domain services that use the platform abstraction layer
- Created all controllers (AuthController, MediaController, RateLimitController, PostController)
- Implemented all middleware components (AuthMiddleware, CorsMiddleware, ErrorMiddleware,
  RateLimitMiddleware)
- Created comprehensive validation schemas with Zod for all request types
- Generated OpenAPI documentation with paths and schemas for all endpoints
- Enhanced token storage with improved encryption
- Implemented thread support in the post interface and implementation
- Added support for listing connected accounts for a NEAR wallet
- Restructured authentication routes to be platform-specific
- Implemented factory pattern in AuthService for platform-specific implementations
- Updated controllers to support platform-specific parameters
- Enhanced OpenAPI documentation to reflect platform-specific routes
- **Enhanced token storage security with versioned encryption**
- **Added token access logging with PII redaction**
- **Implemented secure environment configuration validation**
- **Added NEAR account authorization flow**: Implemented `POST /auth/authorize/near`,
  `DELETE /auth/unauthorize/near`, and `GET /auth/authorize/near/status` endpoints (using standard
  NEAR signature header validation) to manage and check NEAR account authorization status in KV.
  Updated platform login initialization (`/auth/{platform}/login`) to enforce this check.
- **Created PlatformProfile interface and implementation**: Separated profile-related functionality
  from auth classes into dedicated profile interfaces and implementations.
- **Made TokenStorage platform-specific**: Updated TokenStorage to require platform parameter for
  all operations, ensuring proper separation of tokens by platform.
- **Created KV utility classes**: Implemented `KvStore` and `PrefixedKvStore` utility classes for
  standardized KV operations with error handling.
- **Implemented platform error handling**: Created `PlatformError` class and error types for
  standardized error handling across platform implementations.
- **Created base platform classes**: Implemented `BasePlatformClient` and `BasePlatformAuth`
  abstract classes with common functionality for platform implementations.
- **Refactored token refresh and revocation**: Clarified responsibilities between platform client
  (API operations) and platform auth (storage operations).
- **Created KV structure documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation of KV structure and
  patterns used in the application.
- **Refactored classes to use KV utilities**: Updated `TwitterAuth`, `TokenStorage`,
  `TokenAccessLogger`, and `UserProfileStorage` to use the new KV utility classes instead of direct
  KV access.
- **Fixed NEAR authentication in production**: Fixed an issue with the borsher library in the Deno
  Deploy production environment by implementing a fallback mechanism that tries multiple
  serialization approaches to ensure compatibility across both development and production
  environments.
- **Enhanced error handling system**: Implemented a comprehensive error handling system with
  standardized error codes, consistent response formats, and proper HTTP status codes. Created a
  hierarchical error structure with BaseError, ApiError, PlatformError, and platform-specific error
  classes. Added detailed error information including recoverability indicators and
  platform-specific details.
- **Implemented Twitter-specific error handling**: Created a TwitterError class that maps Twitter
  API errors to our standardized format, preserving original error details for debugging.
- **Updated Post Controller with enhanced error handling**: Improved error handling for all
  post-related operations, including proper multi-status responses for batch operations.
