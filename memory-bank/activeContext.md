# Social Media API Proxy Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are preparing for the v1 release of the Twitter API Proxy. The focus is on ensuring the core functionality is stable and well-documented, with particular attention to post dynamics and token management.

### Types and Schemas

We've implemented a centralized approach for type safety and validation:

1. **Zod Schemas**: Defined in the `packages/types/src` directory, these provide runtime validation of API requests and responses.
2. **TypeScript Types**: Derived from Zod schemas using `z.infer<typeof schemaName>`, these provide static type checking during development.

This approach ensures that types and schemas are always in sync, as the TypeScript types are derived directly from the Zod schemas.

### Platform Abstraction

The platform abstraction layer separates core proxy functionality from platform-specific implementations:

- **PlatformAuth**: Handles authentication flows
- **PlatformClient**: Manages API client instances
- **PlatformPost**: Handles post creation and management
- **PlatformMedia**: Manages media uploads and attachments
- **PlatformProfile**: Manages user profile operations

This design allows for easy extension to other social media platforms beyond Twitter.

### NEAR Wallet Integration

The NEAR wallet integration provides a secure way to authenticate users:

- **NearSigner**: Generates and validates NEAR wallet signatures
- **NearAuthService**: Manages NEAR account authorization and token storage
- **Account Linking**: Links NEAR wallets to social media accounts

## Active Decisions

1. **Post Dynamics Improvements**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
   - Enhancing error handling for post operations
   - Improving media attachment handling
   - Optimizing thread creation
   - Ensuring consistent response formats

2. **Token Management Enhancements**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
   - Improving token refresh mechanisms
   - Enhancing token storage security
   - Implementing better error recovery for token operations

3. **SDK Refinement**: âœ… COMPLETED
   - Created modular SDK architecture
   - Implemented shared type definitions
   - Developed NEAR signature generation utilities
   - Built platform-specific clients

## Next Steps

1. **Post Dynamics Fixes**:
   - Complete error handling improvements
   - Enhance media attachment process
   - Optimize thread creation
   - Implement consistent response formats

2. **Token Management**:
   - Enhance token refresh mechanisms
   - Improve error recovery for token operations
   - Implement token expiry management

3. **Testing Framework**:
   - Create unit tests for core components
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints
   - Set up end-to-end testing

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update API documentation
   - Create comprehensive SDK usage examples
   - Document error handling strategies

## Current Challenges

1. **Post Dynamics Edge Cases**:
   - Handling rate limiting during high-volume posting
   - Managing media upload failures gracefully
   - Ensuring consistent behavior across different post types

2. **Token Management Reliability**:
   - Handling token refresh failures
   - Managing expired tokens
   - Recovering from authentication errors

3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Setting up comprehensive testing framework
   - Creating test fixtures and helpers
   - Mocking external dependencies
