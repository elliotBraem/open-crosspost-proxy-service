# Social Media API Proxy Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We have successfully implemented the core functionality of the Twitter API Proxy and are now
preparing for the v1 release. The focus has been on ensuring stability, comprehensive testing, and
proper documentation.

### Recent Achievements

1. **Testing Framework Implementation**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Implemented a comprehensive testing strategy with BDD-style tests
   - Created robust mocking strategies for external dependencies
   - Successfully implemented controller tests with thorough edge case coverage
   - Documented best practices for mocking in the testing-strategy.md file

2. **Error Handling Consolidation**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Consolidated error handling around `@crosspost/types` error system
   - Implemented consistent HTTP status code mapping
   - Enhanced error propagation across the system
   - Improved error detail creation for better client feedback

3. **Dependency Injection Refactoring**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Implemented proper constructor injection throughout the codebase
   - Improved testability by making dependencies explicit
   - Enhanced modularity and reduced coupling between components
   - Simplified testing with mock dependencies

4. **SDK Development**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created modular SDK architecture with three packages:
     - `@crosspost/types`: Shared type definitions
     - `@crosspost/sdk`: Main API client with platform-specific implementations
   - Implemented comprehensive documentation for SDK usage

5. **SDK Error Handling Improvements**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Implemented error categorization system for easier error type checking
   - Created utility functions for error type detection (isAuthError, isRateLimitError, etc.)
   - Added error information extraction utilities (getErrorMessage, getErrorDetails)
   - Implemented error context enrichment for better debugging
   - Created apiWrapper utility for consistent error handling
   - Updated request.ts to use new error utilities
   - Documented error handling approach in error-handling-strategy.md

### Current Focus Areas

1. **Documentation Enhancement**:
   - Updating API documentation with the latest endpoints and parameters
   - Creating comprehensive SDK usage examples
   - Improving flow diagrams for authentication and API calls
   - Ensuring README files are clear and informative

2. **Final Testing and Stability**:
   - Expanding test coverage for all controllers and services
   - Testing error propagation across the system
   - Implementing more complex scenarios like partial success and recovery
   - Ensuring consistent behavior across different post types

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimizing KV operations for better performance
   - Implementing proper caching strategies
   - Enhancing rate limit handling for high-volume scenarios

4. **SDK Authentication Improvements**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Simplified authentication to use direct authentication only
     - Each request requires fresh NearAuthData with signature
     - Removed cookie-based authentication for improved security
   - Improved developer experience with simplified authentication flow
     - Updated SDK README with authentication examples
     - Added `setAuthentication` method for explicit auth setting
   - Enhanced security through per-request signatures
     - Each request requires a fresh signature
     - No persistent authentication state in browser
     - Reduced attack surface by eliminating cookie-based vulnerabilities

## Architecture Overview

### Platform Abstraction

The platform abstraction layer separates core proxy functionality from platform-specific
implementations:

- **PlatformAuth**: Handles authentication flows
- **PlatformClient**: Manages API client instances
- **PlatformPost**: Handles post creation and management
- **PlatformMedia**: Manages media uploads and attachments
- **PlatformProfile**: Manages user profile operations

This design allows for easy extension to other social media platforms beyond Twitter.

### NEAR Wallet Integration

The NEAR wallet integration provides a secure way to authenticate users:

- **NearSigner**: Generates and validates NEAR wallet signatures
- **NearAuthService**: Manages NEAR account authorization and token storage
- **Account Linking**: Links NEAR wallets to social media accounts

### Types and Schemas

We've implemented a centralized approach for type safety and validation:

1. **Zod Schemas**: Defined in the `packages/types/src` directory, these provide runtime validation
   of API requests and responses.
2. **TypeScript Types**: Derived from Zod schemas using `z.infer<typeof schemaName>`, these provide
   static type checking during development.

This approach ensures that types and schemas are always in sync, as the TypeScript types are derived
directly from the Zod schemas.

## Next Steps

1. **Release Preparation**:
   - Finalize documentation
   - Complete remaining tests
   - Perform final code review
   - Prepare release notes

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add support for additional social media platforms
   - Implement advanced security features (key rotation, user-specific key derivation)
   - Enhance monitoring and observability
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern for improved reliability
