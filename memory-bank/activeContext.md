# Twitter API Proxy Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are at the initial setup phase of the Twitter API Proxy project. The focus is on establishing the project structure, setting up the development environment, and implementing the core authentication flow.

## Recent Changes

- Created project documentation in the memory bank
- Defined the system architecture and design patterns
- Outlined the technical requirements and constraints

## Active Decisions

1. **Authentication Strategy**:
   - Using OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for secure authentication
   - Implementing token encryption before storage
   - Designing a session mechanism for client applications

2. **API Design**:
   - RESTful API design for all endpoints
   - Consistent error response format
   - Comprehensive input validation

3. **Storage Strategy**:
   - Using KV for token storage with encryption
   - Using D1 for rate limit tracking and logging
   - Implementing proper data partitioning for performance

## Next Steps

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Initialize the Cloudflare Workers project with Wrangler
   - Set up TypeScript configuration
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Set up the testing framework

2. **Core Authentication Implementation**:
   - Implement the OAuth initialization endpoint
   - Create the OAuth callback handler
   - Develop the token storage service
   - Implement the token refresh mechanism

3. **API Foundation**:
   - Set up the routing system with itty-router
   - Implement authentication middleware
   - Create the CORS handling middleware
   - Develop the rate limiting middleware

4. **Twitter API Integration**:
   - Set up the Twitter API client
   - Implement the tweet posting endpoint
   - Create the timeline retrieval endpoint
   - Develop the media upload functionality

## Current Challenges

1. **Token Security**:
   - Ensuring proper encryption of tokens at rest
   - Implementing secure token refresh mechanism
   - Preventing token leakage in logs and responses

2. **Rate Limiting Complexity**:
   - Handling Twitter's complex rate limiting system
   - Implementing proper backoff strategies
   - Balancing client needs with API limitations

3. **Media Upload Handling**:
   - Managing chunked uploads for larger media
   - Tracking upload progress
   - Handling various media formats and sizes

## Open Questions

1. How should we handle long-running media uploads within the Workers execution time constraints?
2. What's the optimal strategy for token refresh to minimize potential downtime?
3. How can we best implement circuit breaking for Twitter API failures?
4. What metrics should we prioritize for monitoring and alerting?

## Current Development Environment

- Local development using Wrangler for Workers simulation
- Testing against Twitter API sandbox environment
- Using TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Implementing Jest for unit and integration testing
