# Twitter API Proxy Project Brief

## Project Overview
A secure Cloudflare Workers proxy for the Twitter API that allows authorized frontends to perform Twitter actions on behalf of users who have granted permission. The system securely stores OAuth tokens, handles refreshes, enforces rate limits, and supports all major Twitter API functions including media uploads.

## Core Requirements

1. **Secure Authentication**
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow with Twitter
   - Securely store and manage user tokens
   - Support token refresh and revocation
   - Authenticate client applications with API keys

2. **Comprehensive API Support**
   - Support all major Twitter actions (tweet, retweet, like, reply, etc.)
   - Handle media uploads for tweets
   - Support tweet deletion and management
   - Enable interaction with Twitter content

3. **Security & Performance**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper rate limiting (both Twitter API and client-side)
   - Enforce strict CORS policies for client applications
   - Optimize for global edge distribution via Cloudflare

4. **Reliability & Monitoring**
   - Implement circuit breaking for Twitter API
   - Provide graceful error handling
   - Log all operations for monitoring
   - Set up health checks and alerts

## Technical Stack

- **Cloudflare Workers**: Main proxy service
- **Cloudflare KV**: Token and configuration storage
- **Cloudflare D1**: Complex data storage (rate limiting, logs)
- **Cloudflare Workers Secrets**: Sensitive credential storage
- **TypeScript**: Primary development language
- **twitter-api-v2**: Twitter API communication
- **itty-router**: API routing
- **jose**: JWT handling
- **Bun**: Package manager and runtime

## Project Goals

1. Create a secure, reliable proxy for Twitter API operations
2. Simplify Twitter integration for authorized client applications
3. Ensure proper handling of user authentication and permissions
4. Maintain high performance and availability
5. Implement comprehensive security measures
6. Support core Twitter API functions for posting and interaction

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully authenticate users with Twitter
2. Securely store and manage user tokens
3. Process all supported Twitter API actions
4. Handle media uploads properly
5. Enforce appropriate rate limits
6. Restrict access to authorized applications only
7. Maintain high availability and performance
8. Properly log and monitor all operations

## Implementation Status

The project has progressed from the initial setup phase to active implementation. The core infrastructure, authentication system, API endpoints, and middleware have been implemented. The focus is now on testing, refinement, and ensuring all components work together seamlessly.

### Completed Components
