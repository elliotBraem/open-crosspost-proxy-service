# Social Media API Proxy Progress

## Project Status: Migration Phase

The project is transitioning from Cloudflare Workers to Deno Deploy to improve compatibility with
the twitter-api-v2 library. We've implemented a platform-agnostic architecture that makes it easier
to adapt the service for other social media platforms beyond Twitter. The core infrastructure,
authentication system, API endpoints, and middleware have been implemented.

## What Works

- âœ… CORS handling middleware
- âœ… Error handling middleware
- âœ… Platform-specific authentication routes
- âœ… OAuth initialization endpoint
- âœ… OAuth callback handler
- âœ… Token storage service with Deno KV
- âœ… Token refresh mechanism
- âœ… Token revocation endpoint
- âœ… NEAR wallet signature authentication
- âœ… Factory pattern for platform-specific auth implementations
- âœ… Versioned encryption for token storage
- âœ… Token access logging with PII redaction
- âœ… Secure environment configuration validation
- âœ… Post creation endpoint
- âœ… Repost functionality
- âœ… Quote post functionality
- âœ… Post deletion endpoint
- âœ… Like/unlike functionality
- âœ… Reply functionality
- âœ… Thread support
- âœ… Media upload endpoint
- âœ… Chunked upload support
- âœ… Media status endpoint
- âœ… Media attachment to posts
- âœ… Rate limit tracking with TwitterApiRateLimitPlugin
- âœ… Rate limit status endpoint
- âœ… Redis-based request caching (optional)
- âœ… Platform abstraction interfaces
- âœ… Twitter-specific implementations
- âœ… Domain services
- âœ… All controllers (AuthController, MediaController, RateLimitController, PostController)
- âœ… All middleware components (AuthMiddleware, CorsMiddleware, ErrorMiddleware,
  RateLimitMiddleware)
- âœ… Validation schemas with Zod for all request types
- âœ… OpenAPI documentation with paths and schemas for all endpoints (updated for header-based auth)
- âœ… Connected accounts listing for NEAR wallets
- âœ… NEAR account authorization flow (using standard NEAR signature header validation)
