# Social Media API Proxy Progress

## Project Status: Post-Migration Phase

The project has successfully migrated from Cloudflare Workers to Deno Deploy, improving
compatibility with the twitter-api-v2 library. We've implemented a platform-agnostic architecture
that makes it easier to adapt the service for other social media platforms beyond Twitter. The core
infrastructure, authentication system, API endpoints, and middleware have been implemented and are
now running on Deno Deploy.
