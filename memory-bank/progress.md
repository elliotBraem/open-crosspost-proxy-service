- âœ… Cloudflare Workers project initialization
- âœ… TypeScript configuration
- âœ… Core project structure
- âœ… Routing system with itty-router
- âœ… Authentication middleware
- âœ… CORS handling middleware
- âœ… Error handling middleware
- âœ… OAuth initialization endpoint
- âœ… OAuth callback handler
- âœ… Token storage service
- âœ… Token refresh mechanism
- âœ… Token revocation endpoint
- âœ… Client application authentication
- âœ… Tweet posting endpoint
- âœ… Retweet functionality
- âœ… Quote tweet functionality
- âœ… Tweet deletion endpoint
- âœ… Like/unlike functionality
- âœ… Reply functionality
- âœ… Media upload endpoint
- âœ… Chunked upload support
- âœ… Media status endpoint
- âœ… Media attachment to tweets
- âœ… Rate limit tracking with TwitterApiRateLimitPlugin
- âœ… Rate limit status endpoint
- âœ… Redis-based request caching (optional)

## What's In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Comprehensive testing of all endpoints
- ðŸ”„ API documentation for client developers
- ðŸ”„ Monitoring and logging setup
- ðŸ”„ Advanced rate limiting strategies

## What's Left to Build

### Security Features

- â¬œ Token encryption implementation refinement
- â¬œ Enhanced input validation and sanitization
- â¬œ Circuit breaker implementation for API failures

### Monitoring and Observability

- â¬œ Structured logging implementation
- â¬œ Metrics collection
- â¬œ Health check endpoint enhancement
- â¬œ Alert configuration

### Testing

- â¬œ Comprehensive unit tests
- â¬œ Integration tests
- â¬œ End-to-end tests
- â¬œ Performance tests
- â¬œ Security tests

### Deployment

- â¬œ Staging environment setup
- â¬œ Production environment setup
- â¬œ CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Known Issues

1. Media uploads require OAuth 1.0a credentials which need to be properly configured
2. Redis connection management in serverless environment needs optimization
3. Error handling for specific Twitter API errors could be improved
4. Token refresh mechanism needs more robust error recovery
5. Rate limit data is not persisted across worker restarts

## Next Milestones

1. **Testing Framework (Target: Week 1)**
   - Set up comprehensive testing framework
   - Implement unit tests for core functionality
   - Create integration tests for API endpoints

2. **Security Enhancements (Target: Week 2)**
   - Implement token encryption
   - Enhance input validation
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern
   - Optimize Redis connection management

3. **Monitoring and Observability (Target: Week 3)**
   - Set up structured logging
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Configure health checks and alerts

4. **Deployment (Target: Week 4)**
   - Set up staging environment
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Prepare for production deployment
