# Social Media API Proxy Progress

## Project Status: Preparing for v1 Release

The project has successfully implemented a platform-agnostic architecture that makes it easier to adapt the service for other social media platforms beyond Twitter. The core infrastructure, authentication system, API endpoints, and middleware have been implemented and are running on Deno Deploy.

We have also completed a major refactoring of the types and schemas system, implementing a centralized approach where TypeScript types are derived from Zod schemas. This ensures consistency between validation and type checking throughout the codebase.

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure
- âœ… Deno project setup with TypeScript configuration
- âœ… Routing system with Hono
- âœ… Error handling middleware
- âœ… CORS handling middleware
- âœ… Authentication middleware
- âœ… Validation middleware with Zod schemas

### Authentication
- âœ… Platform-specific authentication routes
- âœ… OAuth initialization endpoint
- âœ… OAuth callback handler
- âœ… Token storage service with Deno KV
- âœ… Token refresh mechanism
- âœ… Token revocation endpoint
- âœ… NEAR wallet signature authentication
- âœ… Versioned encryption for token storage
- âœ… Token access logging with PII redaction

### Platform Abstraction
- âœ… Platform abstraction interfaces
- âœ… Twitter-specific implementations
- âœ… Base platform classes with common functionality
- âœ… Platform error handling with standardized error types
- âœ… KV utility classes for standardized KV operations

### Post Operations
- âœ… Post creation endpoint
- âœ… Repost functionality
- âœ… Quote post functionality
- âœ… Post deletion endpoint
- âœ… Like/unlike functionality
- âœ… Reply functionality
- âœ… Thread support

### Media Handling
- âœ… Media upload endpoint
- âœ… Chunked upload support
- âœ… Media status endpoint
- âœ… Media attachment to posts

### SDK
- âœ… SDK architecture design
- âœ… Shared type definitions package (@crosspost/types)
- âœ… NEAR signature generation package (@crosspost/near-simple-signing)
- âœ… Main API client package (@crosspost/sdk)

### Types and Schemas
- âœ… Centralized schema and type definitions
- âœ… TypeScript types derived from Zod schemas
- âœ… Organization by domain rather than by request/response
- âœ… Enhanced response types for standardized responses

## What's In Progress

### Post Dynamics Improvements
- ðŸ”„ Enhancing error handling for post operations
- ðŸ”„ Improving media attachment handling
- ðŸ”„ Optimizing thread creation
- ðŸ”„ Ensuring consistent response formats

### Token Management Enhancements
- ðŸ”„ Improving token refresh mechanisms
- ðŸ”„ Enhancing token storage security
- ðŸ”„ Implementing better error recovery for token operations

## What's Next

### Testing Framework
- â¬œ Unit tests for core components
- â¬œ Integration tests for API endpoints
- â¬œ End-to-end testing
- â¬œ Test fixtures and helpers
- â¬œ Mock implementations for external dependencies

### Security Enhancements
- â¬œ Metadata separation for token storage
- â¬œ Token expiry management
- â¬œ Enhanced input validation and sanitization
- â¬œ Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- â¬œ Request size limits
- â¬œ Rate limit backoff strategies

### Monitoring and Observability
- â¬œ Structured logging
- â¬œ Metrics collection
- â¬œ Alerting configuration
- â¬œ Enhanced health check endpoints

### SDK Enhancements
- â¬œ Comprehensive testing for SDK packages
- â¬œ Additional examples and documentation
- â¬œ Publish packages to npm

## Known Issues

1. Deno KV is still in beta/unstable status
2. Limited storage capacity on Deno KV free tier
3. Rate limit data is not persisted across worker restarts
4. Input validation is inconsistent across endpoints
5. NearAuthService still uses direct KV access instead of KvStore utilities
