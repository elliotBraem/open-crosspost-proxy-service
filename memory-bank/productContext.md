# Social Media API Proxy Product Context

## Problem Statement

Integrating directly with social media APIs presents several challenges for frontend applications:

1. **Security Risks**: Exposing OAuth tokens in frontend code creates significant security
   vulnerabilities
2. **Rate Limiting Complexity**: Managing complex rate limiting systems is difficult from
   client-side code
3. **Token Management**: Securely storing and refreshing tokens is challenging in frontend
   environments
4. **Cross-Origin Limitations**: Direct API calls from browsers face CORS restrictions
5. **Implementation Overhead**: Each frontend application must implement the same integration logic
6. **Media Upload Complexity**: Media upload processes are complex and often require specific
   credentials

## Solution

The Social Media API Proxy provides a secure, managed interface between frontend applications and
social media platforms:

1. **Secure Token Handling**: OAuth tokens are never exposed to frontend code, remaining securely
   stored in Deno KV
2. **Centralized Rate Limiting**: The proxy handles all rate limit tracking and backoff strategies
3. **Automated Token Refresh**: Tokens are automatically refreshed when needed without client
   involvement
4. **CORS-Enabled Endpoints**: Properly configured CORS headers allow browser-based applications to
   interact with the API
5. **Simplified Client Integration**: Clients need only implement a simple REST API rather than the
   full OAuth flow
6. **Unified Media Handling**: The proxy manages the complex media upload process, including chunked
   uploads and processing
7. **Platform Abstraction**: A unified interface allows clients to interact with multiple social
   media platforms through a consistent API

## User Experience Goals

### For End Users

1. **Seamless Authentication**: Simple, secure authentication process with social media platforms
2. **Consistent Performance**: Reliable access to functionality without rate limit errors
3. **Data Privacy**: Assurance that their credentials are securely handled
4. **Transparent Permissions**: Clear understanding of what actions the application can perform on
   their behalf
5. **Multiple Account Support**: Ability to connect multiple social media accounts to a single NEAR
   wallet

### For Client Developers

1. **Simple Integration**: Easy-to-use API that abstracts platform complexity
2. **Reduced Security Burden**: No need to handle sensitive OAuth tokens
3. **Consistent Reliability**: Built-in handling for rate limits and API changes
4. **Comprehensive Functionality**: Access to all needed features through a unified API
5. **Platform Agnostic**: Ability to interact with multiple social media platforms through a single
   API

## Key Workflows

### User Authentication Flow

1. User initiates authentication in client application
2. Client sends NEAR wallet signature to proxy's auth endpoint
3. Proxy redirects to social media platform OAuth page
4. User authorizes the application on the platform
5. Platform redirects back to proxy with authorization code
6. Proxy exchanges code for tokens and stores them securely
7. User is redirected back to client application with session identifier
8. Client application can now make API calls on user's behalf using NEAR wallet signatures

### Post Creation Flow

1. Client application collects post content and media (if any)
2. Client sends data to proxy's post endpoint with NEAR wallet signature
3. Proxy validates the signature and retrieves user's tokens from secure storage
4. Proxy handles any media uploads to the platform
5. Proxy posts the content using the user's credentials
6. Proxy returns success/failure response to client

## Value Proposition

1. **Enhanced Security**: Properly secured OAuth implementation with no token exposure
2. **Simplified Development**: Reduced implementation complexity for client applications
3. **Improved Reliability**: Centralized handling of rate limits and API changes
4. **Comprehensive API Support**: All major functions available through a unified interface
5. **Media Handling**: Simplified media upload process with support for images and videos
6. **Platform Agnostic**: Support for multiple social media platforms through a single API
7. **NEAR Integration**: Authentication using NEAR wallet signatures
