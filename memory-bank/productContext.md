# Social Media API Proxy Product Context

## Problem Statement

Integrating directly with social media APIs presents several challenges for frontend applications:

1. **Security Risks**: Exposing OAuth tokens in frontend code creates significant security vulnerabilities
2. **Rate Limiting Complexity**: Managing complex rate limiting systems is difficult from client-side code
3. **Token Management**: Securely storing and refreshing tokens is challenging in frontend environments
4. **Cross-Origin Limitations**: Direct API calls from browsers face CORS restrictions
5. **Implementation Overhead**: Each frontend application must implement the same integration logic
6. **Media Upload Complexity**: Media upload processes are complex and often require specific credentials

## Solution

The Social Media API Proxy provides a secure, managed interface between frontend applications and social media platforms:

1. **Secure Token Handling**: OAuth tokens are never exposed to frontend code, remaining securely stored in Deno KV
2. **Centralized Rate Limiting**: The proxy handles all rate limit tracking and backoff strategies
3. **Automated Token Refresh**: Tokens are automatically refreshed when needed without client involvement
4. **CORS-Enabled Endpoints**: Properly configured CORS headers allow browser-based applications to interact with the API
5. **Simplified Client Integration**: Clients need only implement a simple REST API rather than the full OAuth flow
6. **Unified Media Handling**: The proxy manages the complex media upload process, including chunked uploads and processing
7. **Platform Abstraction**: A unified interface allows clients to interact with multiple social media platforms through a consistent API

## User Experience Goals

### For End Users

1. **Seamless Authentication**: Simple, secure authentication process with social media platforms
2. **Consistent Performance**: Reliable access to functionality without rate limit errors
3. **Data Privacy**: Assurance that their credentials are securely handled
4. **Transparent Permissions**: Clear understanding of what actions the application can perform on their behalf
5. **Rich Media Support**: Ability to upload images and videos with proper handling of alt text for accessibility
6. **Multiple Account Support**: Ability to connect multiple social media accounts to a single NEAR wallet

### For Client Developers

1. **Simple Integration**: Easy-to-use API that abstracts platform complexity
2. **Reduced Security Burden**: No need to handle sensitive OAuth tokens
3. **Consistent Reliability**: Built-in handling for rate limits and API changes
4. **Comprehensive Functionality**: Access to all needed features through a unified API
5. **Flexible Implementation**: Support for various usage patterns including threads, quote posts, and media uploads
6. **Platform Agnostic**: Ability to interact with multiple social media platforms through a single API

## Key Workflows

### User Authentication Flow

1. User initiates authentication in client application
2. Client sends NEAR wallet signature to proxy's auth endpoint
3. Proxy redirects to social media platform OAuth page
4. User authorizes the application on the platform
5. Platform redirects back to proxy with authorization code
6. Proxy exchanges code for tokens and stores them securely
7. User is redirected back to client application with session identifier
8. Client application can now make API calls on user's behalf using NEAR wallet signatures

### Post Creation Flow

1. Client application collects post content and media (if any)
2. Client sends data to proxy's post endpoint with NEAR wallet signature
3. Proxy validates the signature and retrieves user's tokens from secure storage
4. Proxy handles any media uploads to the platform
5. Proxy posts the content using the user's credentials
6. Proxy returns success/failure response to client

### Media Upload Flow

1. Client application prepares media file (image or video)
2. Client sends media to proxy's media upload endpoint with NEAR wallet signature
3. Proxy handles the appropriate upload process based on file size and type
4. For large files, proxy manages chunked upload process
5. For videos, proxy monitors processing status
6. Proxy returns media ID to client for use in posts
7. Client can optionally set alt text for accessibility

## Value Proposition

1. **Enhanced Security**: Properly secured OAuth implementation with no token exposure
2. **Simplified Development**: Reduced implementation complexity for client applications
3. **Improved Reliability**: Centralized handling of rate limits and API changes
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Global edge network ensures high performance
5. **Comprehensive API Support**: All major functions available through a unified interface
6. **Media Handling**: Simplified media upload process with support for images and videos
7. **Platform Agnostic**: Support for multiple social media platforms through a single API
8. **NEAR Integration**: Authentication using NEAR wallet signatures

## Target Users

1. **Web Applications**: Browser-based apps that need social media integration
2. **Mobile Applications**: Apps that need a secure backend for social media operations
3. **Internal Tools**: Company dashboards that manage social media presence
4. **Multi-platform Products**: Products that need consistent social media integration across platforms
5. **Content Management Systems**: Systems that publish content to social media
6. **NEAR Ecosystem Applications**: Applications built on NEAR that want to integrate with social media
