# Twitter API Proxy Testing Strategy

## Testing Philosophy

The Twitter API Proxy testing strategy focuses on ensuring reliability, correctness, and maintainability of the codebase. Our approach prioritizes:

1. **Integration Testing**: Testing the SDK against the running proxy service to verify end-to-end functionality.
2. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation to ensure they work as expected.
3. **Type Safety**: Leveraging TypeScript's type system to catch errors at compile time.
4. **Error Handling**: Verifying that errors are properly caught, handled, and communicated to clients.
5. **Security**: Ensuring that authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms work correctly.

## Testing Tools

We use Deno's built-in testing capabilities:

1. **Deno.test**: Deno's native test runner for writing and running tests.
2. **@std/testing/bdd**: BDD-style testing with `describe` and `it` functions.
3. **@std/assert** and **@std/expect**: Assertion libraries for verifying test conditions.
4. **@std/testing/snapshot**: For snapshot testing where appropriate.
5. **Test Steps**: Using `t.step()` for organizing tests into logical groups.
6. **Sanitizers**: Leveraging Deno's built-in sanitizers for resources, operations, and exits.

## Test Organization

Tests are organized into the following categories:

1. **Unit Tests**: Located in `tests/unit/` directory, testing individual components in isolation.
2. **Integration Tests**: Located in `tests/integration/` directory, testing interactions between components.
3. **SDK Tests**: Located in `tests/sdk/` directory, testing the SDK against the running proxy service.
4. **Middleware Tests**: Located in `tests/middleware/` directory, testing middleware components.

## Test Patterns

### BDD Style Tests

We use the BDD style for writing tests:

```typescript
import { describe, it } from "jsr:@std/testing/bdd";
import { expect } from "jsr:@std/expect";

describe("AuthService", () => {
  it("should authenticate a user with valid credentials", async () => {
    // Test code
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

### Test Steps

For complex tests, we use test steps to organize the test flow:

```typescript
Deno.test("Post creation flow", async (t) => {
  // Setup
  const client = createTestClient();
  
  await t.step("authenticate user", async () => {
    // Authentication logic
  });
  
  await t.step("create post", async () => {
    // Post creation logic
  });
  
  await t.step("verify post exists", async () => {
    // Verification logic
  });
});
```

### Permission Management

We explicitly manage permissions in tests to ensure they run correctly:

```typescript
Deno.test({
  name: "KV storage test",
  permissions: {
    read: true,
    write: true,
    net: false,
  },
  fn: async () => {
    // Test code
  },
});
```

## Testing Strategies

### SDK Integration Testing

The primary focus is on testing the SDK against the running proxy service:

1. **Authentication Flow**: Test the complete authentication flow from SDK to proxy to platform.
2. **Post Operations**: Test all post operations (create, delete, like, etc.) through the SDK.
3. **Error Handling**: Verify that errors are properly propagated from the proxy to the SDK.
4. **Rate Limiting**: Test rate limiting behavior and backoff strategies.

### Mocking

For unit tests, we mock external dependencies:

1. **Platform APIs**: Mock platform-specific API responses.
2. **KV Storage**: Mock KV operations for predictable test behavior.
3. **Authentication**: Mock authentication flows for testing without real credentials.

### Test Data

We use a combination of:

1. **Fixtures**: Predefined test data stored in `tests/fixtures/`.
2. **Factories**: Functions that generate test data with customizable properties.
3. **Snapshots**: For comparing complex objects and responses.

## Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage of critical paths:

1. **Authentication Flows**: 100% coverage of authentication logic.
2. **Post Operations**: 100% coverage of post creation, deletion, and interaction.
3. **Error Handling**: 100% coverage of error paths.
4. **Rate Limiting**: 100% coverage of rate limiting logic.

## Continuous Integration

Tests are run automatically on:

1. **Pull Requests**: All tests must pass before merging.
2. **Main Branch**: Tests are run after each merge to ensure continued functionality.

## Test Environment

Tests run in a controlled environment:

1. **Isolated KV**: Tests use a separate KV namespace to avoid affecting production data.
2. **Mock Platform APIs**: Tests use mock platform APIs to avoid hitting real APIs.
3. **Test Credentials**: Tests use dedicated test credentials where real APIs are needed.

## Best Practices

1. **Test Independence**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests.
2. **Clear Assertions**: Each test should have clear assertions that verify specific behavior.
3. **Descriptive Names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested.
4. **Setup and Teardown**: Properly set up and tear down test resources.
5. **Error Cases**: Test both success and error cases.
6. **Boundary Conditions**: Test boundary conditions and edge cases.
7. **Performance**: Tests should run quickly to enable fast feedback loops.
