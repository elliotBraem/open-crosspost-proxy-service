# Social Media API Proxy Security Plan

This document outlines the security plan for the Social Media API Proxy, focusing on protecting
sensitive user data, particularly OAuth tokens stored in Deno KV.

## Security Objectives

1. **Data Protection**: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
2. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. **Audit Trail**: Maintain comprehensive logs of security-relevant operations
4. **Secure Configuration**: Validate and enforce secure configuration settings
5. **Incident Response**: Prepare for security incidents with proper monitoring and alerting

## Implementation Phases

The security enhancements are being implemented in three phases:

### Phase 1: Core Security (Completed)

- **Enhanced Encryption with Key Versioning**: Implemented versioned encryption for tokens stored in
  Deno KV
- **Token Access Logging**: Implemented comprehensive logging for all token operations with PII
  redaction
- **Secure Default Configurations**: Enhanced environment configuration to ensure secure defaults

### Phase 2: Structural Enhancements (Planned)

- **Metadata Separation**: Store sensitive token data separately from non-sensitive metadata
- **Token Expiry Management**: Add explicit expiry tracking in the KV store
- **Anomaly Detection**: Monitor for unusual token access patterns

### Phase 3: Advanced Security Features (Planned)

- **Key Rotation Mechanism**: Implement automatic key rotation on a schedule
- **User-specific Key Derivation**: Implement key derivation functions for user-specific encryption
  keys
- **Enhanced Token Revocation**: Implement immediate token invalidation for compromised tokens

## Security Best Practices

### Encryption

- Use AES-GCM for authenticated encryption
- Use proper key sizes (16, 24, or 32 bytes)
- Generate cryptographically secure random IVs
- Never reuse IVs with the same key
- Implement proper key management

### Access Control

- Validate all API requests with proper authentication
- Implement NEAR wallet signature verification
- Use API keys for client applications
- Validate origins against allowed list
- Implement proper CORS restrictions

### Logging and Monitoring

- Redact PII in all logs
- Implement structured logging
- Create alerts for security events
- Monitor for unusual patterns
- Maintain audit logs for security operations

### Secure Coding

- Validate all input data
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies up to date
